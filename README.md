##### Using Python to Play Cupid

> You're a matchmaker who has drawn 5 men and 4 women at a singles mixer. At the
end of the event, each attendee has handed you a ranked list of singles (of the
opposite sex) they'd be interested in having coffee with. Your job is to
suggest optimal pairings. We'll walk you through the algorithm that we
implemented to solve this "stable matching problem" at Jodi365, using Python.

- Speaker: Anil Kumar

##### Remote Control your PC using Python and Kivy

> The talk is about controlling a PC application using pybluez and a mobile app.
The mobile app is written in Kivy, a cross-platform Python framework for NUI
development.

#### [January 31st 2015](#january-31st-2015)

##### Image Processing

> This talk will be brief description of software available for image
processing, various features, various outcomes that can be obtained, etc.
Python will be used as the programming language. The talk will also cover
various effects which are possible with the images along with how to code them.

##### How Python changed my view of programming

> My journey into programming started with Python. The talk is about how Python 
made me to dive into programing which I never liked at college. Example programs 
which I have backup of, and my first Python project.

- Speaker: Rengaraj

##### My Journey with the world of Open Source

> This talk is about how I got into the world of Open Source and what it has
done to me, both as a programmer and as a person. We'll explore some of my
earliest commits and Pull Requests as we go on a journey from then, till now.

- Speaker: Shrayas
- Slides: [Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/shrayasr/my-journey-with-the-world-of-open-source)
- Video: [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/album/3253406/video/119355618)

##### Exception handling in Python

> I will discuss the try-except protocol for exception-handling in python,
explain the exception heirarchy and how to create new exception classes.

- Speaker: Prof. Amritanshu Prasad
- Slides: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q3gt011i2edindi/exception_handling.pdf?dl=0)
- Video: [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/album/3253406/video/119506004)

##### Pystrokes

> PyStokes is a Cython library for computing Stokes flows produced by spheres.
The core of the library is written in Cython which can be called from pure
python, so that the user can choose to work in pure python and still use the
library.  Read more on GitHub. I will also explain some basic usage of the
Cython and how we have used it to accelerate our computations.

- Speaker: Rajesh Singh
- Slides: [IMSc](http://www.imsc.res.in/~rsingh/discussion/files/slides/pystokes.pdf)
- Video: [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/album/3253406/video/118873669)

##### Hangman: Design and Implementation

> As part of Chennaipy activities, we did a Hangman project.  Some cool things
we did as part of the project - unit testing, supporting Python 2 and 3, code
coverage analysis, packaging and distribution. This talk will give an overview
of the lessons from the Python Project. 

- Speaker: Vijay Kumar
- Slides: [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/VijayKumarBagavathSi/hangman-design-and-implementation)
- Video: [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/album/3253406/video/119147267)

##### Build your own CPU

> The advent of affordable FPGAs with a decent number of gates has made
hardware design accessible for anyone interested. But describing hardware
accurately in software can be tricky. This is where HDLs come into the picture.
And as with everything else, there is a Python library for easing into writing
pure HDL code. This talk introduces development with MyHDL, a Python library to
generate descriptions of digital hardware.
