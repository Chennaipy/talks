famous paintings such as "Starry Night" to our every day photos to give them an
enchanting look and feel?

- Speaker: Krishna Sangeeth

##### Python Immigrants!

I thought of sharing the Python Ecosystem from the Immigrant perspective. The
difference between someone like you and me is that you plan better, aim first
and shoot it. Whereas, I do not have the luxury hence my approach will be shoot
first, aim later. In other words, I have to jump into various Python Libraries
such as, NumPy, Scipy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow even before mastering Python. I
have to study the entire ecosystem together. I thought of sharing this ecosystem
in the context of on-going excitement in Data Science, as an Immigrant to Python
community.

testing state machines. We will see how we can use Hypothesis to solve a couple
of popular puzzles.

- Speaker: Suresh VV

##### Write code for humans, not machines

Any average programmer can write code by sitting hours and hours, pushing
themselves through the sleepless nights but what it takes to write a better
readable software?.

Forget about the design patterns, I will be talking ground
zero from naming variables to handling errors in your python code. At the end of
my talk the audience should be able to read their own code after 6 months
without uttering the words "why did I write like this?"

- Speaker: Ashok Govindarajan
- Slides: [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/AshokGovindarajan/data-structures-in-python)

##### Obscure Python Implementations

When people talk about using Python, they are usually referring to the most
common *implementation* of Python - CPython. Some talk about using PyPy or
Jython or IronPython. In this talk, I'd like to present some of the more obscure
Python implementations, the ones that only very few might have heard about and
also talk about their features and the reasons for which you might want to use
them. Since I want to talk about the very obscure ones, I might talk about
defunct implementations also. So for those cases it might not make sense to talk
about good reasons to use them (beyond just playing around with them for fun).

- Speaker: Subil
- Repo: [obscure python implementations](https://github.com/dragsubil/talks/tree/master/2016-12-24%20obscure%20python%20implementations)

#### [October 22nd 2016](#october-22nd-2016)

##### Diving deep into dictionary

Every pythonista knows how to use a dictionary. They claim its the fastest data structure in python and tell, one should 
not expect ordered elements from it (Atleast in python 2.x). But I am not sure how many of them are aware what happens 
when a dictionary is initialized?, why its not ordered?, why is it so fast?, how it alters itself when it grows?. I 
will talk about all of these and after the talk the audience will know whats really happening behind a dictionary.

- Speaker: Naren

##### Demystifying how imports work in Python

It just so happens python abstracts away the inner workings of import statement beautifully. But are we aware of how python
behaves when it encounters an import statement for a module? Better yet what is a module actually? Packages anybody?
How would different import styles compare with each other. Any Best practices when importing modules. What about 
that `__init__.py` you saw the last time you read someone else's code.

- Speaker: [Tasdik Rahman](https://twitter.com/tasdikrahman/)
- Slides: [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/tasdikrahman/demystifying-how-imports-work-in-python/)

##### Measuring Cyclomatic complexity in Python

A brief intro to cyclomatic complexity. This is a topic related to Python code quality. Cyclomatic Complexity is basically
the measure of how complicated a unit of code is - it counts all the independent paths through a unit of code to produce 
a unique score. Obviously a function that has a very high cyclomatic complexity score (say 100) needs to be refactored.

Some basic reference material that would be useful to attend this talk:

1) [What is cyclomatic complexity](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_testing_dictionary/cyclomatic_complexity.htm)

2) [Example for cyclomatic complexity](http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2013/12/12/the-roots-of-static-analysis/)

- Speaker: Ashok

• How to render an HTML template

• Extending Flask with Plugins

• Flask when compared with Django

- Speaker: Hafizul Azeez

#####  Computer vision with deep learning

- Speaker: Manish Shivanandhan
- Slides: [GoogleDocs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ss8zH3NmTl5EWLaCzOjhSZt8bm7-z-JK8_OnkDo4Yjo/edit#slide=id.p)

#####  Behaviour Driven Development

Developers are familiar with the Test Driven Development(TDD) where the requirements are turned into very specific test cases 
and the code blocks are tested thoroughly by writing unit tests. But these test cases do not show the developers how the product
should behave to the end user, instead it focuses on the specifics of the each code block. This is the reason why many product 
managers wonder, why the developers can't get the product right in minimal iterations. By following BDD with TDD, the developer 
can know "how to test the product?" instead of just testing the implementation of the code.

At the end of this talk, the audience will get an introduction to BDD and they will know where to use BDD for better development
of products.

- Speaker: Naren Ravi

#### [July 23rd 2016](#july-23rd-2016)

#####  Python gotchas

Python aims to be a clean and consistent language that avoids surprises.
However, there are few edge cases that can be confusing to newcomers or
sometimes even the experienced ones. If you are not aware of these gotchas,
you might conclude that the language is poorly designed when you come 
across it in production. Some cases are intentional but can be surprising, for example

~~~~
hash(2) => 2 
hash(-2) => -2 
hash(-1) => -2 #really?
~~~~

It might seem strange at first glance, but it makes more sense once you
are aware of the underlying reasons for the surprises. This will be an 
interactive talk where I will be talking about these gotchas with few 
examples and the audience will be able to guess what/why python behaves 
the way it does.

- Speaker: Naren

#####  Think your python code is slow?

Many of us blame python for being slow. Ever though it's not python's
fault all of those times. May be it's our code that is at fault. It is
useless trying to blindly optimize a program without measuring where 
it is actually spending its time. There are many things that can be
measured on our code. This talk will focus on profiling different parts 
of your program like line by line analysis, memory used by each objects,
memory leaks, objects that causes these memory leaks, etc. The profiling
and analysis will be done using python standard libraries (cProfile
and profile) and also using some open source libraries (line_profiler 
and memory_profiler)

- Speaker: Ambarish KC

#####  Setting up Emacs for Python development

In this talk, I'll showcase how Emacs can be setup as a productive 
environment for Python development. Specifically, I'll introduce
various packages that can be very helpful when working with Python

- Speaker: Kiran

#####  Efficient unicode integration in Python

Have you ever worked with unicode in Python? If you have, you must be
familiar with the encode and decode methods that you would've used.
But these functions aren't exactly user friendly. You must have used 
random encode decode copy-pastes from stack overflow. The error messages 
are often cryptic. For example, for an 

~~~~
encode(str, encoding='utf-8')

UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xa0 in position 0: 
ordinal not in range(128).
~~~~

Knowledge of the inner workings of handling unicode streams is imperative
for efficient coding with Unicode, as is evident with the decode error 
for the encode method.

- Speaker: Hans Krupakar

#### [May 28th 2016](#may-28th-2016)

#####  Introduction to Celery

Cases when number of tasks are submitted to task queue which needs to 
be processed asynchronously Celery saves the day. Celery distributes 
and coordinates the tasks over multiple workers (may be running on 
different machine). It also scales well with addition/removal of 
workers on the fly to handle those occasional burst work load between 
long periods of calm.

With the flexibility to support multiple message brokers and custom 
extension for various modules it addresses a wide variety of retirements.

- Speaker: Shanmuga

##### Towards probabilistic programming in Python

Uncertainty is an integral part of the way we perceive the world. It has been
known since more than a century that probability theory is the tool for
reasoning about uncertainty. In the last two decades, there has been explosion
of the use of probabilistic methods in all areas of science, engineering,
medicine, and most recently, the analysis of data, "big" or small. In
implementing such methods using generic computer languages, the main obstacle
has been that computer programs have no semantics of dealing with random
variables. This shortcoming leads to unnecessarily tedious code and a large gap
between theory and application. The idea of probabilistic programming seeks to
remedy this situation by creating programming languages in which random
variables are first class citizens. I will describe three python packages that
take the first steps in implementing probabilistic programming paradigms and
conclude with a survey of the DARPA initiative of probabilistic programming.

C++/Java/C# and similar languages. Applying these concepts in python could be a
bit tricky as Python might feel lacking features that we've been comfortably
using in Java/C++ like "public", "private", "protected", "abstract", "virtual"
and so many other keywords. This talk would emphasize on unlearning Java/C++
style OOP and learn a more mature OOP design that python emphasizes. Concepts
like DuckTyping, Introspective OO design and run-time polymorphism will be
covered.

prototyping models and then implement models in Java so they can leverage
Hadoop. With libraries like Dumbo make it possible to build and run machine
learning models in Python that can make predictions over very large datasets.
The talk will describe the problem and the proposed solution with example code.
