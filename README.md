done to me, both as a programmer and as a person. We'll explore some of my
earliest commits and Pull Requests as we go on a journey from then, till now.

- Speaker: Shrayas

##### Exception handling in Python

> I will discuss the try-except protocol for exception-handling in python,
explain the exception heirarchy and how to create new exception classes.

- Speaker: Prof. Amritanshu Prasad
- Slides: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q3gt011i2edindi/exception_handling.pdf?dl=0)
- Video: [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/album/3253406/video/119506004)

##### Pystrokes

> PyStokes is a Cython library for computing Stokes flows produced by spheres.
The core of the library is written in Cython which can be called from pure
python, so that the user can choose to work in pure python and still use the
library.  Read more on GitHub. I will also explain some basic usage of the
Cython and how we have used it to accelerate our computations.

- Speaker: Rajesh Singh
- Slides: [IMSc](http://www.imsc.res.in/~rsingh/discussion/files/slides/pystokes.pdf)
- Video: [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/album/3253406/video/118873669)

##### Hangman: Design and Implementation

> As part of Chennaipy activities, we did a Hangman project.  Some cool things
we did as part of the project - unit testing, supporting Python 2 and 3, code
coverage analysis, packaging and distribution. This talk will give an overview
of the lessons from the Python Project. 

- Speaker: Vijay Kumar
- Slides: [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/VijayKumarBagavathSi/hangman-design-and-implementation)
- Video: [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/album/3253406/video/119147267)

##### Build your own CPU

> The advent of affordable FPGAs with a decent number of gates has made
hardware design accessible for anyone interested. But describing hardware
accurately in software can be tricky. This is where HDLs come into the picture.
And as with everything else, there is a Python library for easing into writing
pure HDL code. This talk introduces development with MyHDL, a Python library to
generate descriptions of digital hardware.

#### [December 20th 2014](#december-20th-2014)

##### Python and its Functions

> Functions in Python are First class. They can be passed to and from
functions. They can be created inside other functions and a lot
more. This talk proposes to introduce this concept.

- Speaker: Shrayas Rajagopal
- [IPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/shrayasr/talks/blob/master/2014/dec/chennaipy/functions-and-decorators/Functions.ipynb)

##### Breaking Free with Rope

> Embedded systems have crazy restrictions. And one embedded Python
interpreter I happened to work on, had a restriction that you couldn't
have more that 500 distinct variable names in your application! We
quickly hit this limit. This talk will cover how we overcame this
restriction using Rope, a refactoring library for Python and some
Python scripting hackery.

- Speaker: Vijay Kumar
- Slides: [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/VijayKumarBagavathSi/breaking-free-with-rope)

##### Introduction to Sage

> Sage is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under
the GPL. It builds on top of many existing open-source packages:
NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Sympy, Maxima, GAP, FLINT, R and many
more. This talk will be an introduction to Sage.

##### Sentiment Analysis using Python

> On a Sunday afternoon, you are bored. You want to watch a particular
movie, but you know there are mixed reviews for the movie. You want to
know the overall feeling on the movie, based on their reviews and not
just based on their ratings. We will show you how to use a machine
learning model to classify the sentiment of a review automatically,
all with Python!!

- Speaker: Venkatesh
- Slides: [Github](http://vumaasha.github.io/pychennai-sentiment-analysis/),

##### Solving graph problems using NetworkX

NetworkX is a python package which can be used for handling
graphs. Through the talk I want to touch on how we see problems which
can be solved by graph all around and how we can leverage the NetworkX
module to solve challenging problems.

- Speaker: Krishna Sangeeth
- Slides: [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/kskrishnasangeeth/solving-graph-problems-using-networkx)

##### Decorators 

> Decorators are an interesting way of doing some magic with functions
in Python. Talk 1 (Python and its Functions) will set the base for
this. If time permits and people are interested, we can see an
application of Talk 1 VIZ Decorators. Decorators are a concept that is
gaining widespread use in Python because it is just that easy to
read. This talk proposes to give an introduction to them.

- Speaker: Shrayas Rajagopal
- [IPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/shrayasr/talks/blob/master/2014/dec/chennaipy/functions-and-decorators/Decorators.ipynb)

##### Building a Website Using Static Site Generators

> Static site generator is a software/framework which outputs html files
by combining text and templates, thus generating a website/blog. This
talk will focus on how to use few of them & host the site on github.

- Speaker: Gaurav Sherawat
- Slides: [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/GauravSehrawat1/static-site-generator-in-python)
