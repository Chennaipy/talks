#### Towards probabilistic programming in Python

Uncertainty is an integral part of the way we perceive the world. It has been known since more than a century that probability theory is the tool for reasoning about uncertainty. In the last two decades, there has been explosion of the use of probabilistic methods in all areas of science, engineering, medicine, and most recently, the analysis of data, "big" or small. In implementing such methods using generic computer languages, the main obstacle has been that computer programs have no semantics of dealing with random variables. This shortcoming leads to unnecessarily tedious code and a large gap between theory and application. The idea of probabilistic programming seeks to remedy this situation by creating programming languages in which random variables are first class citizens. I will describe three python packages that take the first steps in implementing probabilistic programming paradigms and conclude with a survey of the DARPA initiative of probabilistic programming.

- Speaker: Prof.Ronojoy Adhikari

##### Object Oriented Programming Paradigms in Python

> Learn OOP the pythonic way. Most of us have learnt OOP fundamentals using
C++/Java/C# and similar languages. Applying these concepts in python could be a
bit tricky as Python might feel lacking features that we've been comfortably
using in Java/C++ like "public", "private", "protected", "abstract", "virtual"
and so many other keywords. This talk would emphasize on unlearning Java/C++
style OOP and learn a more mature OOP design that python emphasizes. Concepts
like DuckTyping, Introspective OO design and run-time polymorphism will be
covered.

- Speaker: Chandrashekar Babu
- Slides: [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/ch4ndru/python-oop-paradigms-and-pythonisms)

System (CMS), it becomes a cinch to provide new functionality. This talk
provides a gentle introduction to Plone, its long track record of success and
why you owe it to yourself to look at it in closer detail. Some most used and
attractive features of Plone will be highlighted.

- Speaker: Suresh V

##### Managing Jenkins with Python

> The benefits of Continuous Integration systems is well understood today.
Jenkins, a Continuous Integration system has been adopted by many organizations
today. But as the no. of Jenkins jobs increases, managing them becomes tedious.
Autojenkins, a Python package for interacting the with Jenkins, can be used for
managing Jenkins jobs. In this talk, I will show how we use Autojenkins at
Zilogic to easily manage over 150 jobs.

#### [May 23rd 2015](#may-23rd-2015)

##### Predictive Models at Scale using Dumbo

> The data science stack for Python is mature and robust. Libraries like Numpy,
SciPy and scikit-learn allow data scientists to build predictive models easily.
However, when it comes to making predictions on large volumes remains an
operational challenging. Data scientists typically end up using Python just for
prototyping models and then implement models in Java so they can leverage
Hadoop. With libraries like Dumbo make it possible to build and run machine
learning models in Python that can make predictions over very large datasets.
The talk will describe the problem and the proposed solution with example code.

- Speaker: Nikhil Ketkar

permission.

- Speaker: Gaurav Sherawat

##### Breaking Free with Rope

> Embedded systems have crazy restrictions. And one embedded Python
interpreter I happened to work on, had a restriction that you couldn't
have more that 500 distinct variable names in your application! We
quickly hit this limit. This talk will cover how we overcame this
restriction using Rope, a refactoring library for Python and some
Python scripting hackery.

- Speaker: Vijay Kumar
- Slides: [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/VijayKumarBagavathSi/breaking-free-with-rope)

##### Sentiment Analysis using Python

> On a Sunday afternoon, you are bored. You want to watch a particular
movie, but you know there are mixed reviews for the movie. You want to
know the overall feeling on the movie, based on their reviews and not
just based on their ratings. We will show you how to use a machine
learning model to classify the sentiment of a review automatically,
all with Python!!

- Speaker: Venkatesh
- Slides: [Github](http://vumaasha.github.io/pychennai-sentiment-analysis/),
- [Code](https://github.com/vumaasha/pychennai-sentiment-analysis)

##### Solving graph problems using NetworkX

module to solve challenging problems.

- Speaker: Krishna Sangeeth
- Slides: [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/kskrishnasangeeth/solving-graph-problems-using-networkx)

##### Decorators

> Decorators are an interesting way of doing some magic with functions
in Python. Talk 1 (Python and its Functions) will set the base for
this. If time permits and people are interested, we can see an
application of Talk 1 VIZ Decorators. Decorators are a concept that is
gaining widespread use in Python because it is just that easy to
read. This talk proposes to give an introduction to them.

- Speaker: Shrayas Rajagopal
- [IPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/shrayasr/talks/blob/master/2014/dec/chennaipy/functions-and-decorators/Decorators.ipynb)

##### A Gentle Introduction to Generators and Coroutines in Python

> Though a lot of people know Python, very few people actually
understand generators and coroutines enough to understand how awesome
they can be. This talk aims to provide a basic understanding of how
and when they can be used, and why they are an important utility in
your Python toolkit.

- Speaker: Kiran Gangadharan
- Slides: [Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/kirang89/a-gentle-introduction-to-generators-and-coroutines)

##### Getting started with SQLAlchemy

> SQLAlchemy is a really quirky and awesome way to do ORMs in
python. And it has quite a learning curve at least at the initial
stages. Once you get to know the general idea of how things work, it
becomes pretty awesome. I've just started working with it and just
want to talk about some things that'll help with getting started with
SQLAlchemy.

- Speaker: Shrayas Rajagopal

##### Fun with Pandas

> Pandas is Python's answer to R's Dataframes.  If that does not make
sense, not to worry. Just think of Excel's functions in Python, only
more versatile and able to handle much larger amounts of data. This
will be a gentle introduction to Pandas, following which, we will try
to apply the concepts to a Crunchbase's public dataset.

- Speaker: Sharmila Gopirajan
